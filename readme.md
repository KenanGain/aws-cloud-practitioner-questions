## 🏆 Answers & Explanations

1. **B. You only pay for what you use, without upfront costs or long-term commitments**  
   - AWS’s “pay-as-you-go” model ensures you are billed only for consumed resources.

2. **C. Amazon RDS**  
   - Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database PaaS offering.  
   - (Lambda is FaaS; EC2 is IaaS; S3 is object storage.)

3. **C. Configuring Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies**  
   - Customers are responsible for IAM, data encryption settings, and securing their OS and applications.  
   - AWS is responsible for the security “of” the cloud (hardware, hypervisor, data centers).

4. **C. AWS Organizations + Service Control Policies (SCPs)**  
   - AWS Organizations lets you group accounts, and SCPs enforce restrictions centrally.  
   - AWS Config tracks resource configurations; IAM manages identities; CloudTrail logs API calls.

5. **C. AWS Lambda**  
   - Lambda runs code in response to events without managing servers—true serverless compute.  
   - Fargate is serverless containers, not event-driven code.

6. **C. Amazon S3 Standard-IA**  
   - Standard-IA is ideal for infrequently accessed objects needing rapid retrieval.  
   - One Zone-IA has lower availability; Glacier Deep Archive is for long-term archival.

7. **B. Reserved Instances (3-year term)**  
   - Committing to a longer term Reserved Instance typically yields the highest discount for continuous workloads.  
   - Spot Instances can be interrupted; On-demand has no commitment; Dedicated Hosts are expensive.

8. **B. AWS Pricing Calculator**  
   - The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you estimate monthly costs before resource deployment.  
   - Cost Explorer and Budgets are for analyzing and monitoring after resources are in use.

9. **C. Provides best practices and guidance to build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure**  
   - The Well-Architected Framework is a set of design principles and best practices across five pillars.  
   - It does not automate provisioning (that’s CloudFormation) or change service quotas.

10. **B. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group spanning multiple Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer**  
    - This architecture ensures fault tolerance: if one AZ fails, Auto Scaling replaces instances in another AZ.  
    - A single instance (A) is not fault-tolerant; S3 (C) is for static hosting; Lambda with SQS (D) addresses compute scaling but not classic web hosting behind a load balancer.
